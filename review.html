            productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you
            have done it in teams?
        </h3>

    <div class="border">
        <p>The tools used are proven and established. I didn’t find that I was in need of any further features /
            functions.<br>
            I'm comfortable using Visual Basic Code to write HTML & CSS.<br>
            I could have made better use of Trello by adding more cards to improve tracking of my tasks.<br>
            GitHub is useful to keep all code and project resources in a central repository.<br>
            As the project was not very complex, I don’t think it would have been beneficial to work in a team.

        <p>With more experience and training, I would be able to make the website more efficient by using methods and
            functions I’m not yet familiar with. <br>
            I could make more use of classes within CSS to improve efficiency and reduce duplication of effort when
            applying common styles.<br>
            Slack could be used in a team environment to enable easy interaction between team members.

    <div class="border">
        <p>I could make better use of Trello by creating more cards to track tasks.<br>
            I could continue to learn HTML and CSS which will then enable me to create a website which would be more
            efficient.<br>
            Depending on the size of the project, it may be beneficial to work in a team and allocate tasks accordingly.

        <p>Thoroughly test all areas of the project and ensure any changes/fixes do not have any adverse effect on
            other parts of the project.<br>
            Ensure all links work throughout the website.<br>
            Ensure the website is consistent in its layout throughout the different pages.<br>
            Ensure all images and text are aligned satisfactorily.<br>
            Test the website on different devices and check for any unexpected behaviour with the UI & UX.

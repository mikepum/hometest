    </div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>
            Information technology can speed up the time it takes new products to reach the market. Companies can
            write product requirement documents by gathering market intelligence from proprietary databases,
            customers and sales representatives. <br>Information Technology in
            Stakeholder integration is another important objective of information technology. Using global 24/7
            interconnectivity, all stakeholders are permanently reachable around the clock.<br>
            Process improvement is another key IT business objective. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
            allow managers to review sales, costs and other operating metrics on one integrated software platform,
            usually in real time. <br>
            Although the initial IT implementation costs can be substantial, the resulting long-term cost savings
            are usually worth the investment. IT allows companies to reduce transaction and implementation
            costs.<br>
            Cost savings, rapid product development and process improvements help companies gain and maintain a
            competitive advantage in the marketplace. Companies can use rapid prototyping, software simulations and
            other IT-based systems to bring a product to market cost effectively and quickly.<br>
            Companies that survive in a competitive environment usually have the operational and financial
            flexibility to grow locally and then internationally. IT is at the core of operating models essential
            for globalization, such as telecommuting and outsourcing. <a

        <p>Digital projects can be managed using different project management methodologies. Agile with Scrum is a
            very common approach in software development, but other methods like Waterfall, PRINCE2, and Extreme
            Programming are similarly used for developing and completing digital projects. <a

        <p>I will initially design the sitemap. This will include links between pages and details of the information
            on each page. I will also create / import any images that I will need.
            After building the website, I will thoroughly test it to make sure there aren’t any broken links /
            images are aligned etc.
            Any improvements or fixes needed will be implemented and the website retested.
            I plan on using Trello to split down the tasks associated with creating my website/blog.
            This will make the tasks more manageable and easier to track my progress on them.

        <h3><a id="unit1_1.4"></a>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
            projects to fail? Why
        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>Misalignment with business processes: Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user
            experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the
            initiative is very likely to fail. Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products
            seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success.<br>
            Lack of cross-functional expertise: Every digital project should have someone with business process
            management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end
            operational processes.<br>
            Limited digital strategy. Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or
            initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. <br>
            Fixed plans that don’t account for change: Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent
            tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Digital project plans should
            be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment. <a

    <div class="border">
        <p>Research the available systems and software and evaluate which is best suited to the project. Determine

            For example, if there was a cost associated with any software required, or if extra staff were needed,
            could this be absorbed into the budget?<br>
            In this example, producing a website / blog, the software / tools being used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it describes the structure of a Web page.
            HTML consists of a series of elements which tell the browser how to display the content.
            HTML elements are represented by tags which label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph",
            "table",and so on
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page <a

            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web

            Git is an open-source version control system. When developers create something (an app, for example),
            they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official
            (non-beta) release. Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in
            a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version
            of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new
            changes, download them, and contribute.
            Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the
            hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people. <a

        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>On 25 May 2018 the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force. At its
            heart, GDPR set out to update rules around privacy and consent for the digital age and to ensure that
            organisations are responsible in their handling of their customers' personal data – and that those
            customers are aware of how their data is being used and that they consent to it.
            The legislation is designed to ensure that precautions are made to protect personal data, and that if an
            organisation falls victim to an attack or breach where personal data is accessed, they report it to
            their customers and the authorities within 72 hours of being made aware of the incident. <a

            I’m happy using the tools supplied and found Visual Studio Code easy to use and navigate.
            GitHub is nice to have, as this provides a central repository to store the latest versions of the code.<br>

            Visual Studio Code is good for creating and editing HTML and CSS for projects and Trello is fine for keeping

            I didn’t use Slack as this was an individual project.<br>

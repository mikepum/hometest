        <h3>About Me....</h3>
        <div class="border">
            <p>I have been interested in technology for the last 30 years from when I was a teenager using an Amiga 500
                in the 1990’s. <br>
                I managed to get a trainee position at Barclays Bank in 1998 where I became a Mainframe Operations
                Analyst. <br>While in this role, I gained experience in programming a couple of programming languages
                and scheduling tools. In my later years doing this, I was the lead of a small team of 3 running
                Operational Acceptance Testing cycles and also the implementation into the production environment. <br>
                After 12 years at Barclays, I fancied a change so left there and subsequently had contract positions
                working for the Halifax, Co-Op Bank and RBS/IBM doing a similar role to previously.<br>
                I have also been programming Arduino microcontrollers as a hobby for the last couple of years.</p>

        <h3>Why am I attending CodeNation?</h3>
        <div class="border">
            <p>I’m attending the course at <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank"><b>CodeNation</b></a>
                to
                bring me up to date with the more recent digital development languages/tools & processes which will
                hopefully lead to employment.

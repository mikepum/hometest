    <div class="border">
        <p>I decided to go with quite a simplistic look as I find some websites difficult to read if they are too
            busy.<br>
            Index - This is my home page ‘About Me’. The content here is just a brief description of my background. I’ve
            used CSS to format *, h1 & h3 throughout the website.<br>
            The images on the About Me page have been sized uniformly and have padding so they look consistent. One of
            them also has a hyperlink to send me an email if clicked.<br>
            I created a class ‘button’ for the links to the other pages. This currently determines the text colour.<br>
            The remaining pages - Unit 1, Unit 2, References & Project Review are similar to the Index and use the
            classes previously set up.<br>
            Also, any references are hyperlinked where appropriate.

    </div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>On the web, if you did not write or create the article, graphic, or data that you found, then you need
            permission from the owner before you can copy it.<br>
            Copyright is the right of the owner to reproduce or permit someone else to reproduce copyrighted works.<br>
            Most copyright owners on the web will not object to the personal use of their web pages. For example, if you
            found a web page that you wanted to print, most developers would not find it a violation of their copyright
            if you were to print out the page. <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/copyright-on-the-web-3466815"
                target="_blank" class="references">[Source]</a><br>

            Other constraints include:
            Domain Name - One of the most important features of any website is a unique and memorable domain name, one
            that is easily understood and easily spelled. Obviously one has to be chosen that isn’t already taken.<br>
            Mobile friendly - Have to make sure that the website looks and functions as expected on mobile devices.

        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However,
            currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or
            impossible for some people to use. <br>
            Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define
            what is needed for accessibility. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/"
                target="_blank" class="references">[Source]</a><br>
            Web accessibility means that websites, tools and technologies are designed and developed so that people with
            disabilities can use them.<br>
            Web accessibility depends on several components working together, including web technologies, web browsers
            and other user agents, authoring tools and websites.

        <h3><a id="unit2_1.7"></a>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>The most common filetypes for websites are:
            .HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file
            Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files. These files contain all the HTML for the website<br>
            .CSS — Cascading StyleSheet
            CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look.<br>
            .JS - JavaScript
            These files contain the JavaScript for the website<br>
            .GIF — Graphics Interchange Format
            The most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images.<br>
            .JPG/ .JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file
            Used for image or photo files used in the website<br>
            .PNG — Portable Network Graphics
            PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport
            advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support.
